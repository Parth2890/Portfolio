PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:-
Volansys Technologies, Ahmedabad, India Associate Engineer Dec 2022 - Present
 • During this period I enhanced the Linux board support package(U-boot bootloader, Linux Kernel System Programming, Device Driver Work Flow) And the build system like Yocto.
• Along with the project execution sharpened my bare-metal skills working on nrf52840 and its peripherals.

  
NXP_CAS:-
        • My Role is to solve Customer queries related to porting of external sensors, Displays, and WiFi chipset 
        on the NXP EVKs Such as the IMX6/7/8 series.
        • I have also debugged the issue related to U-boot Bootflow, and device driver errors to any peripheral 
        such as i2c, and Audio codecs and CAN open protocol, USB protocol.
        • I have always been inclined towards customer satisfaction and by uplifting myself towards more  
        knowledge I helped to extend the project contract by 6 months from client.
Korelock:-
• In My commencing to the project I have acquired knowledge of Barematel & freeRTOS Programming and their requirement on the nRF52840 Board.


Volansys Technologies, Ahmedabad, India Trainee Engineer May 2022 - Nov 2022 
      • I acquired in-depth knowledge about the 802.11 Protocol(Connection establishment, Security, Data Path, Data Flow) in addition to that I have gained knowledge about the OSI Model.
NXP_SAE:-
• I worked on the WiFi driver and debugged various issues regarding connection establishment, packet throughput, and security with debug tools like WireShark, GDB, Valgrind, etc.
• My Role was to Reproduce the issue on the local setup using the Customer environment, Capture the logs, Analyze the logs, Debug them, and Fix them by applying various patches in C Prog. Language & provided a solution.
• I Worked on the NXP Wireless chipsets 88xx, 90xx, x86, i.MX Boards.




Volansys Technologies, Ahmedabad, India Intern  Jan 2022 - April 2022 
• As a part of the basic training program I enhanced basic and advanced Linux commands, The basics of C programming language, Advanced C, Data structure & algorithms, Linux system programming, and Git.
• Along with the Training As a part of the college curriculum I made One Project named “Blue_Lib”. 
• Through this Project, I have Successfully created a HAL Peripheral Library for the STM32F103 microcontroller using which we can create memory-constrained and optimized final binary executable files and tested various HAL functions on actual hardware by creating test files for various peripherals on blue-lib microcontroller development board, and gained knowledge on the area of embedded software development.
• We were also awarded with the 2nd Runners-up in Project Expo-2022.

ACDC Tech, Gujarat, India Intern June 2021 – Aug 2021 
• I Learned a lot more technical and practical knowledge about Embedded Systems, as well as the assembly of basic electronics such as soldering through holes and SMD components & drilling into the PCB.
• The basic knowledge of different sensors, modules their working, interfacing, and output characteristics were taught in great detail and fluency. 
• Finally, after gaining knowledge of these sensors and their interfacing and output behavior we made a project "ESP32 webcam” which is used to keep an eye on anything such as doors, storage, etc.
